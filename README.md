Looks for term-independent markers of firm success via cross-sectional stock market data.

This group project was made as part of an Econometric Machine Learning class taken at UNC Chapel Hill. 

We analyze data primarily obtained through the WRDS database, building off of the work of Chen and Zimmerman's Open Asset Pricing project (https://www.openassetpricing.com/). We sought to use Machine Learning methods to see if any identifiable patterns or predictors emerged as pertinent for asset evaluation, independent of a time period's market environment or notable events (ie, the tech bubble of the early 2000s, or the recession of 2008).

Final_Project.pdf has the R markdown. "SECURITIES ANALYSIS..." is the paper itself. Enjoy.
